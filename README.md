# outs1dr-core

> the engine behind *outs!dr*

---

**outs1dr-core** is the TypeScript core responsible for handling all the essential syncing logic on desktop devices.

You might ask — why TypeScript? 🤨  
Well… I tried doing it in Rust, but got lazy (:  
Normally I would use C++ for this, but I wanted to try something new.
